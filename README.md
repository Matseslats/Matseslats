Trident was a CanSat competing in the 2022 Norwegian and 2022 European CanSat Competition.

Cansat Trident aimed to plan, develop and demonstrate guided landing using a tri-rotor-drone. We used internal instruments that measured position, rotation, and acceleration in 3 dimensions during the flight to assist with the guided landing. In addition, we aimed to take atmospheric measurements such as temperature, pressure, and atmospheric composition during the flight.
